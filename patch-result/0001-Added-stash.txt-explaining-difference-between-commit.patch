+This file explains the difference between git commit and git stash.

+Difference between git commit and git stash:
+
+- git commit: Saves your changes to the local repository history. These are permanent and part of your project's history.
+- git stash: Temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes that you donâ€™t want to commit yet. You can reapply them later.
