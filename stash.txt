This file explains the difference between git commit and git stash.

Difference between git commit and git stash:

- git commit: Saves your changes to the local repository history. These are permanent and part of your project's history.
- git stash: Temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes that you donâ€™t want to commit yet. You can reapply them later.
